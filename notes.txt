Contributions of the paper:
- An optimisation strategy that can be generalised to a wide variety of kernels
 employed in many computational science codes. The key feature common
 to these kernels is that they usually fit the L1 cache of commodity processors.
- Automation of such code optimizations in a framework for the resoloution of partial
 differential equations through the Finite Element Method, called Firedrake.
 This allows us to perform an in-depth performance evaluation of the various
 transformations in real-world computations.
