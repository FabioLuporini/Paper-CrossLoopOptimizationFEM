% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[longend,linesnumbered]{algorithm2e}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

\newcommand{\code}[1]{\lstset{basicstyle=\small\tt}\lstinline£#1£\lstset
{basicstyle=\footnotesize\tt}}

% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
In many fields, like computational fluid dynamics, computational electromagnetics, and structural mechanics, programs model phenomena by means of partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical techniques, like Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Element Method (FEM), are widely employed in real-world applications to approximate solutions of PDEs. Unstructured meshes are often used to discretize the domain of a PDE, since their geometric flexibility allows solvers to be extrimely effective. However, they are also one of the main responsible for performance degradation, due to the introduction of indirect accesses (e.g. \texttt{A[B[i]]}) to access mesh components. A typical problem, therefore, is that implementing a scientific application requires a great effort, other than domain knowledge, and even more time is needed to optimize their execution time. 

An unstructured mesh discretizes the domain of the equation into two- or three-dimensional cells (or ``elements''), within which the solution is sought. As the number of elements can be of the order of millions, a major issue is the time required to perform the numerical method, which can be hours or days. To address this issue, domain-specific languages (DSLs), which ease the programming burden and enable highly-efficient parallel execution, have been developed. The successful porting of Hydra, a CFD industrial application devised by Rolls Royce for turbomachinery design (based on FVM, roughly 50000 lines of code and mesh sizes that can be over 100 millions edges), to the OP2 DSL~\cite{pyop2ics}, demonstrates the effectiveness of the DSL approach to implementing PDEs solvers~\cite{OP2-hydra}. 

OP2, as well as Lizst~\cite{lizst}, adopt a kernel-oriented programming model, in which the computation semantics is expressed through self-contained functions (or ``kernels''). A kernel is applied to all elements in a set of mesh components (e.g. edges, vertices, elements), with an implicit synchronization between the application of two consecutive kernels. On commodity multi-cores, a kernel is executed sequentially by a thread, while parallelism is achieved partitioning the mesh and assigning each partition to a thread. Together with the indirections problem, kernel optimization is the major concern in unstructured mesh applications. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a domain-driven optimization strategy for a class of kernels used in FEM.

We focus on Finite Element Local Assembly (``assembly'', in the following), a fundamental step of FEM that covers an important fraction of the overall computation run-time, typically in the range 30$\%$-60$\%$. During the assembly phase, the solution of the PDE by executing a suitable kernel over all elements in the discretized domain. A kernel's working set is usually small enough to fit the L1 cache; it might need L2 cache when (very) high-order methods are employed to improve the accuracy of the solution. However, we do not consider the latter case. An assembly kernel is characterized by the presence of an affine, usually non-perfect loop nest, where individual loops are rather small (the trip count rarely exceeds 100, with a minimum value of 3, depending on the order of the method). With such small kernels, our work focuses on aspects like minimization of floating-point operations, register allocation and instruction-level parallelism, especially in the form of SIMD vectorisation. 

Our study is conducted in the context of Firedrake, a multilayered system for the automated solution of PDEs through FEM. PDEs are written in Firedrake using a domain-specific language called Unified Form Language (UFL). The high-level UFL notation is used by the Fenics Form Compiler (FFC) to produce assembly kernels. At the core of Firedrake~\cite{firedrake} there is PyOP2~\cite{pyop2ics} - a python implementation of the OP2 abstraction - which triggers compilation of kernels using an available vendor compiler, and eventually manages parallel execution over the unstructured mesh. We exploit the domain knowledge and the structure inherent to FFC's assembly kernels to develop an optimizing compiler for all problems that are expressible in Firedrake. 

The compiler we developed is integrated with PyOP2, and already used in the release of Firedrake~\cite{firedrake-code}. This allows us to evaluate the proposed code transformations in a range of real-world problems, employing different low-order methods (from $p=1$ to $p=4$; the higher, the more expensive a kernel is, but better is the accuracy), and varying the topology of the mesh (2D, 3D, 3D hybrid structured-unstructured, which in turn affect the kernel cost). Performance results show that compiler-generated code for non-trivial assembly kernels, if not adequately transformed, is sub-optimal. A cost-model-driven sequence of source-to-source code transformations, aimed at improving register allocation and register data locality, can result in performance improvements up to 33$\%$ over ``softly-optimized'' code (i.e. where only basic transformations are performed, such as auto-vectorizable loop-invariant code motion, padding and data alignment), and up to 77$\%$ over the original FFC kernels. The contribution of this paper is therefore twofold:
\begin{itemize}
\item An optimisation strategy for a class of kernels widely-used in scientific applications, namely Finite Element Local Assembly kernels. Our approach exploits domain knowledge to go beyond the limits of both vendor (e.g. $icc$) and research (e.g. those based on the polyhedral model) compilers.
\item Automation of such code optimizations in Firedrake, a framework for the resoloution of PDEs through FEMs. This enables performing an in-depth performance evaluation of the proposed optimization strategy in real-world simulations.
\end{itemize}

The paper is organized as follows. ...

%the focus of optimization should be on managing registers, exploiting ILP in its various forms, and reducing loop overhead


% systematic optimization strategy -> discuss the importance of domain knowledge

% A python implementation of OP2, namely PyOP2, is used in the Firedrake project as an intermediate representation for FEM computations. In Firedrake all computational kernels are generated by a compiler, (the Fenics Form Compiler, FFC), whereas in OP2 applications kernels are provided by users. 

%What we do in computational science. Applications motivating our study. The programming model of lizst and op2: ``simple'' kernels applied to sets of mesh elements. The need for optimizing such kernels. Contributions of the paper:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A \textbf{compiler-driven} optimisation approach that can be generalised to a wide variety of kernels employed in many computational science codes. The key feature common to these kernels is that they usually fit the L1 cache of commodity processors.
%\item Automation of such code optimizations in a framework for the resoloution of partial differential equations through the Finite Element Method, called Firedrake. This allows us to perform an in-depth performance evaluation of the proposed optimization strategy in real-world computations.
%\end{itemize}

\section{A Domain-Driven Approach to Code Optimization}
%All the work done in the polyhedral model should be useful, but our kernels fit L1, so they need special attention for what concerns key aspects like managing registers, exploiting ILP in its various forms, and reducing loop overhead.

\section{Performance Evaluation}
%Performance evaluation. We show all of the results got so far and we explain them. We demonstrate the claim that a compiler-driven approach is necessary to obtain maximum performance. Also, our results prove that current vendor compilers still have notable limitations, despite optimizing loop nests that are 1) affine, 2) have no stencil, and 3) ?

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
